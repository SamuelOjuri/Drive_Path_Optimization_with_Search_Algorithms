#Path Optimization with Search Algorithms for an Automotive Navigation System

Artificial intelligence has enormous potential of creating remarkable solutions that improve the quality
of our daily lives. An example is the application of automotive navigation systems that provides
intelligent guidance for traversing routes in a road network of a city. An intelligent agent can use such
automated systems to find the optimal path in several applicable scenarios, such as path optimization
for smart cars, delivery robots, and autonomous vehicles. This study examines path optimization
for a road network in a city using uninformed search algorithms such as Depth First Search (DFS),
Breadth First Search (BFS), and Dijkstra, in comparison with informed search algorithms such as A-star
(A*), considering potentials for improvement in applications. The performance of the algorithms
was compared on a sample route showing the effects of weights such as travel time and distance.
The use of heuristic functions was also analyzed for the performance of informed search algorithms.
The parameters used to compare the performance of the search algorithms include travel time (time
complexity), distance covered (space complexity), speed (performance), and completeness. The results
showed that the best algorithms for path optimization were the A-star algorithm with a defined
heuristic function and the Dijkstra algorithm with the travel time used as weight. The importance of a
rightly optimized search algorithm plays a fundamental role in the success of automotive navigation
systems in production or when used in larger networks. This will also help to improve the efficiency
of the various applications where these algorithms are used thereby creating a more intelligent and
innovative application of path optimization in the field of artificial intelligence.
